### Stock

- Fixed that the average shelf life of a product (on the productcard) was wrong when the corresponding stock entry was edited
- Fixed that when the stock setting "Decimal places allowed for amounts" was set to `0`, unit conversion (if any) failed when adding the corresponding product to stock
- Fixed that consuming a parent product which is not in stock itself (so essentially using any of the child products) may failed when unit conversions were involved (the current stock amount check was wrong in that case)
